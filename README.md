# sasapp

I'm working on it.  I promise.

# Getting Set Up

## Prerequisites

In order to get a sasapp development environment up and running, the following programs need to be installed:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/installing.html)
* [NodeJS](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)
In the future this section should have links to tutorials for specific platforms, or better yet, a step by step guide written by a sasapp developer.

## Configuring your Environment
